# OrchestrateX

OrchestrateX is an advanced multi-model collaborative AI system designed to deliver higher-quality and dynamically refined responses through real-time multi-model critique and feedback. It intelligently selects the best model to answer a user prompt while simultaneously engaging other models as critics to improve the answer on the fly.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Model Selection:** Chooses the most suitable model from a pool (e.g., GLM4.5, GPT-OSS, LLaMa 3, Gemini2.5, Claude .5, Falcon) to generate the initial response.
- **Collaborative Criticism:** Other models provide real-time critiques and suggestions to enhance the output of the answering model.
- **Dynamic Refinement:** The answering model iteratively refines its output based on the feedback.
- **High Output Quality:** Combines strengths of multiple AI models to produce superior results.
- **Flexible UI Concepts:** Supports various user interface designs for different user needs from simple outputs to interactive comparative views.

## How It Works

1. **User Prompt:** A user submits a request (e.g., "Build the landing page for my portfolio website").
2. **Model Selection:** OrchestrateX selects the best model to generate the initial response.
3. **Critique Loop:** Other models evaluate the response in real-time, providing constructive feedback.
4. **Refinement:** The main responding model updates its output based on critiques.
5. **Final Output:** The user receives a highly refined and collaboratively enhanced answer.

## UI Ideas (TBD)

- **Simple Unified Output:** Shows only the final refined answer with an optional details panel for transparency.
- **Interactive Multi-Model View:** Allows users to see the main response alongside critiques from other models, supporting iterative refinement.
- **Progressive Refinement:** Displays initial answers and dynamically updates them during collaborative feedback.
- **Model Visualization Dashboard:** Visual insights into model confidence and critique influence.
- **Conversational Model Personas:** Chat interface where each model acts as a persona contributing to the dialog.
- **Minimal UI:** Focus on quick, clean final answers with orchestration handled transparently in the backend.
