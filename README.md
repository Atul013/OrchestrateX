Integration Architecture Overview
The complete system flow works as follows:
User Query → Phase 1 Model Selection → Best Chatbot Chosen
Initial Response → Phase 2 Criticism Loop → Multiple Critics Provide Feedback
Refinement Process → Improved Response → Repeat Until Convergence
Final Output → User receives only the refined final answer

This architecture creates a sophisticated AI collaboration system that leverages specialized strengths while using collective intelligence to improve response quality through structured criticism and refinement.
