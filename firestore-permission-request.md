Subject: Firestore Access Request for OrchestrateX Development

Hi,

I need to grant Cloud Datastore Owner permissions to sahilkhk001@gmail.com for my OrchestrateX application development project. 

This user needs access to:
- Read/write data to Firestore collections
- Manage database structure for AI model responses
- Configure indexes and security rules
- Monitor database performance and usage

The OrchestrateX project is an AI orchestration platform that requires database access for storing conversation history, model responses, and user preferences.

Please grant the necessary Firestore permissions at your earliest convenience.

Thank you!
```

## Alternative Setup Commands
If you have admin access, you can also use these gcloud commands:

```bash
# Add user as Datastore Owner
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding orchestratex-app \
    --member="user:sahilkhk001@gmail.com" \
    --role="roles/datastore.owner"

# Or add as Firestore Service Agent (more specific)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding orchestratex-app \
    --member="user:sahilkhk001@gmail.com" \
    --role="roles/firebase.admin"
```

## Next Steps
1. Submit the permission request through the Google Cloud Console
2. Wait for admin approval (usually within a few hours)
3. Verify access by testing Firestore operations
4. Configure OrchestrateX backend to use the database
