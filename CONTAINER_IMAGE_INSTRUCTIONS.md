# Container Image URL for Cloud Console

Since the local build failed, here are your options:

## Option 1: Use a Pre-built Image
In the "Container image URL" field in your Cloud Console, enter:
```
gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
```
This is a test image that will deploy successfully, then we can update it later.

## Option 2: Build and Push Manually

### Step 1: Build the image locally
```powershell
# Set your project ID
$PROJECT_ID = "orchestratex"

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/orchestratex .

# Push to Container Registry
docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/orchestratex
```

### Step 2: Use the image URL
```
gcr.io/orchestratex/orchestratex:latest
```

## Option 3: Use Cloud Build (Recommended)

Instead of the container image option, let's use the source deployment:

### Complete these Cloud Console fields:
```
Service name: orchestratex
Region: us-central1
Container image URL: gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
Container port: 8080
Memory: 1 GiB
CPU: 1
Maximum number of instances: 10
Authentication: Allow unauthenticated invocations
```

### Then click "CREATE" and we'll update it afterward with your actual code.

## What to do RIGHT NOW:

1. In your Cloud Console, enter this Container image URL:
   ```
   gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
   ```

2. Set these options:
   - Service name: `orchestratex`
   - Region: `us-central1`
   - Container port: `8080`
   - Memory: `1 GiB`
   - Authentication: `Allow unauthenticated`

3. Click "CREATE"

4. After it deploys successfully, we'll update it with your actual OrchestrateX code.

This gets your service running quickly, then we can update it!
