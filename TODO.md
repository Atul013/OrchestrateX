2. **Model API Reliability** - Third-party APIs may fail  
   - *Mitigation*: Implement fallback models and retry logic
3. **Domain/SSL Issues** - Complex DNS and certificate setup
   - *Mitigation*: Start domain work immediately, have backup domains ready
4. **Algorithm Complexity** - Smart routing may be too complex
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simpler version, iterate improvements

### Dependencies:
- Google Cloud Platform availability
- OpenRouter API stability  
- Third-party model API uptime
- DNS propagation times

4. **Week 4 Issues**: Launch with known issues, fix in maintenance releases

### Daily Standup Required:
- Review previous day's progress
- Identify blockers and dependencies  
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Escalate critical issues immediately
