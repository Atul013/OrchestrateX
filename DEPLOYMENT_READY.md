1. **`DEPLOY_ONE_CLICK.bat`** - Main deployment script
2. **`DEPLOY_FIRESTORE_AUTO.bat`** - Automated deployment logic  
3. **`VERIFY_DEPLOYMENT.js`** - Post-deployment verification
4. **`Dockerfile`** - Production container configuration
5. **`cloudbuild.yaml`** - Google Cloud Build configuration

## 🎬 **HOW TO DEPLOY (Just 3 Steps!)**

### **Step 1: Install Google Cloud CLI**
```bash
# Download and install from:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-windows

# After installation, restart your command prompt
```

### **Step 2: Run One-Click Deployment**
```bash
# In your project folder, run:
DEPLOY_ONE_CLICK.bat

# The script will:
# ✅ Check prerequisites
# ✅ Authenticate with Google Cloud
# ✅ Build Docker container
# ✅ Deploy to Cloud Run
# ✅ Configure environment
```

### **Step 3: Update DNS**
```bash
# Point api.orchestratex.me to your new Cloud Run URL
# (The deployment script will show you the URL)
```

## ✅ **WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

```
User enters prompt on chat.orchestratex.me
          ↓
POST request to api.orchestratex.me/chat
          ↓
Your deployed Firestore backend processes it
          ↓
Prompt stored in Google Cloud Firestore
          ↓
AI response returned to user
```

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION:**

After deployment, run:
```bash
node VERIFY_DEPLOYMENT.js
```

This will test:
- ✅ Health endpoints
